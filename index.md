# Pedro's Astronomy Page

I am a lecturer at the School of Maths and Physics of Queen’s University Belfast and do research in solar system astronomy at the Astrophysics Research Centre.

My past work has been mainly on physical properties of small bodies of the solar system, mainly Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), Centaurs, comets and Trojan asteroids.
